APIs 101
=======

I'm actively writing this book in my spare time.

If you're interested in the book, please subscribe to get every update. When I'm done with it, I will release it free of charge, since it's a tool to myself too.

Depending on the interest I might write another book on advanced techniques for APIs that were left outside the scope on this book. You can learn which things I'm referring if you look at Chapter 5 **What comes next**.

If you'd like to drop me a line, you can do it by creating a new issue at [the repo](https://github.com/sebastialonso/api-101-gitbook) in Github.

Cheers!
