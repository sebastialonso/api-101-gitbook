# Basic Concepts

####In which we discover concepts that will help us communicating back and forth through the web. Also API architecture.

In this section we will be using the command line tool **cURL** (here forth, **curl**), to sample some of the concepts that will showed in the current chapter.

If by any chance, your machine does not have curl installed, you can do it by running

~~~
sudo apt-get install curl
~~~
on Debian-based operative systems, or

~~~
sudo yum install curl
~~~

on Fedora or CentOS.

To run curl, you do

~~~
curl URI_ADDRESS 
~~~
