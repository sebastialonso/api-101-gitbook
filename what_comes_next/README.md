* Authentication

Limiting certain parts of the API for certain users, for example, users editing their profile, or personal information. It is also possible to authenticate your users through third parties, like Facebook, Twitter or Google+.

* Documentation

Also the return value for every route and the parameters needed to access them. There are tools and standards out there precisely for this.
