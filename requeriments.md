# Requeriments

This book assumes you have basic knowledge of the *Ruby* Language, just a tiny bit of the *Sinatra Framework* and the *DataMapper*.

I strongly recommend becoming familiar with the above tools before taking this book, as I won't be able to explain them in full.

Besides the technical cosntraints, there are no such things when it comes to the theorical aspects. In fact, the book is encouraged for those who know little and wish to put in practice what they know.
