# Requeriments

This book assumes you have basic knowledge of the *Ruby* Language, but also of the *Sinatra Web Framework* and the *DataMapper* ORM.

I strongly recommend becoming familiar with the above tools before diving into this book, as I won't be able to explain them in full.

Besides the technical cosntraints, there are no such conditions when it comes to the theorical aspects. In fact, the book is encouraged for those who only have a vague idea and wish to learn more.
