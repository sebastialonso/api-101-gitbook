# What to build

For this project we will build a Music Data Service API.

These are some of the requeriments our API will have to meet:

### Songs

Songs can be listed, created, read, updated and deleted. They must have an id, a title, an artist, a length, a label and at least three different genres.

### Artists

Artists can be listed, read and updated.

### Genres

Genres can be created and read.

### Labels

Labels cannot be created through the public API. As they represent clients, they should only be created by an Administrator. Since this requeriment goes beyond this book, we can only list and read them.
